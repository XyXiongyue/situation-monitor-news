谢谢你，部长先生。我很高兴今天有机会在这里发言
当我在9月份作为美联储理事的第一次演讲中提出我对政策的评估时，我假设核心商品和非住房核心服务的通货膨胀将继续以目前的速度运行。2虽然这在当时是一个有用的工作假设，但今天我将更详细地分析我的通货膨胀前景。具体来说，我将分享我对通货膨胀组成部分的解释，以及这如何影响我对2%目标进展的看法。
住房通货膨胀
住房成本是家庭最关心的问题，也是通货膨胀指数的重要组成部分。但计算住房通胀远非易事。例如，美联储目标的个人消费支出（PCE）价格指数包括经济中所有家庭的住房成本。这似乎适合捕捉价格，因为

Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here today.1

When I offered my assessment of policy in my first speech as a Federal Reserve Governor in September, I assumed inflation for core goods and nonhousing core services would continue to run at current rates.2 While that was a useful working assumption at the time, today I will break down my inflation outlook in more detail. Specifically, I'll share my interpretation of inflation's components and how this influences my perception of progress toward our 2 percent target.

Shelter Inflation
Shelter costs are top of mind for households, and a large component of inflation indices. But calculating shelter inflation is far from simple. For instance, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index that the Fed targets includes housing costs for all households in the economy. That seems appropriate for capturing prices associated with all consumer spending but not ideal as a measure of current supply and demand pressures. Figure 1 makes that clear: As the economy emerged from the pandemic, demand for housing outstripped supply, and market rents for new tenants jumped. But the PCE shelter index for all households lagged, as rents only reset when people move or renew their leases. PCE will always lag market rents.

As recently as last year, the PCE shelter index still had catching up to do, creating uncertainty as to how long measured shelter inflation would remain elevated. This is no longer the case. Indeed, a separate all-tenant rent index—drawn from the same microdata as PCE shelter—caught up to new-tenant rents, while PCE shelter has actually overshot new rents.3 Based on this catchup being complete, I expect a faster fall in PCE shelter inflation.

The current elevated readings for shelter inflation are an after-echo of previous, rather than current, supply–demand imbalances in the economy. For the past two years, we've seen extremely low increases in new-tenant rents. Measures by Cotality and Apartment List show that's persisted in recent quarters. I therefore expect a faster decline in PCE shelter inflation. Two factors give me additional confidence: first, the negative population shock resulting from a reversal in net migration, and second, an elevated ratio of nominal shelter services consumption relative to overall consumption, which has historically been mean-reverting.

Core Nonhousing Services Inflation
Another important part of household budgets is the cost of services besides housing, food, and energy. These services are about half of household spending and include childcare, education, entertainment, and medical expenses. Core nonhousing services inflation has moved sideways this year, somewhat above the average level observed from 2002 to 2007, a useful reference period when core PCE inflation averaged 2 percent. However, I am not worried about nonhousing services.

Wages are the primary driver of service inflation. Many service prices are driven by labor costs; for instance, labor compensation is about 60 percent of value added in leisure and hospitality and 83 percent in education and health services. Over the medium term, nonhousing services will follow labor market pressures.

Unemployment has trended higher for over two years, and wage growth lower. Additional measures of labor market tightness—such as job openings, consumer surveys about the difficulty of finding jobs, long-term layoffs, and the duration of unemployment—have suggested a loosening labor market for several years, tilting nominal wage growth risks toward the downside.

A notable aspect of core services inflation is that not all components are measured from directly observed transactions. Many services components in the index are imputed in various ways and do not capture information about supply–demand imbalances that are relevant for monetary policy. A prime example is portfolio management services, which have contributed a quarter-point to core PCE inflation in the last year, well above their long-run average.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis measures portfolio management costs based on overall revenues generated by asset managers. If the stock market goes up and boosts assets under management, revenues move in tandem since they are typically a fixed percentage fee of assets. What ought to be recorded as an increased quantity of services consumed is instead recorded as increased prices. There may, for national accounting purposes, be a good reason for doing it this way. But, for monetary policy purposes, there is none, and it would be foolish of us to chase statistical quirks rather than focus on actual consumer prices.

Remarkably, long-term trends in the asset management industry point toward fee compression, indicating trend deflation. Morningstar found the average expense ratio paid by investors fell nearly 6 percent in 2024.4 By contrast, PCE recorded a roughly 20 percent increase in portfolio management fees in this period, contributing about 30 basis points to core PCE. If PCE had instead matched industry data with a 6 percent decline, core PCE would have been about 40 basis points lower than officially reported.

Fees have consistently fallen each year for the past two decades, now less than half of what they were in 2005, as seen in figure 2.5 The PCE portfolio management measure contains no signal regarding tightness in the asset management industry, let alone the economy. It contains no signal for the inflation forecast going forward. It should not be used to frame underlying inflation. Yet here we are, keeping interest rates too high because of the phantom inflation of portfolio advisory fees.6

For these reasons, I do not take much signal from nonmarket-based components. When looking at market-based services, inflation in this category has come down dramatically from its peak and moved sideways since mid-2024, at around 3 percent. That is about 10 basis points below its average from 2002 to 2007, which, again, was a period in which PCE inflation was broadly at target. Core nonhousing services inflation only remains elevated compared with this period because of nonmarket components.

Core Goods Inflation
Turning to goods prices, they have been relatively less likely to rise than other index components since the turn of the century. That trend was abruptly disrupted in the aftermath of the pandemic. After that, core goods inflation fell into negative territory for a brief period of around one year. Over the past 12 months, core goods inflation has picked up. The dominant narrative explaining this pattern blames U.S. tariff policy. I am not convinced.

Consider the timing, as shown in figure 3. In core goods PCE, it appears that the increase coincides with the imposition of tariffs during this year. However, in the consumer price index, the upturn began in the middle of 2024. We don't target CPI, but it contains useful information. The evidence that tariff policy neatly coincides with the increase in core goods prices is conflicted.

When thinking through the effect of tariffs on prices, we must remind ourselves that the larger share of incidence or burden of any economic policy—tax, subsidy, or tariff—falls on the more inelastic or inflexible party. This is because the more elastic or flexible party can change its behavior to avoid the burden of the tax. As an importer, the U.S. is relatively more elastic, since we can substitute demand across borders or manufacture goods at home. But producers' factories are installed capital that is stuck in place, and their labor is generally immobile and not easily substitutable across tradable and nontradable sectors. As the largest trade deficit country, there are few substitutes, if any, for American demand, but many substitutes for potential supply.

Product-level estimates of demand and supply elasticities from Anson Soderbery can be used to examine goods-level incidence.7 Figure 4 draws predicted isoincidence lines. The 45-degree line characterizes goods which have equal supply and demand elasticities, meaning incidence is evenly split between exporter and importer. The overwhelming majority of goods lie below the 45-degree line, meaning importers bear less burden. Figure 5 shows the cumulative distribution of import value based on the incidence absorbed by exporters. These elasticities imply that, for about 70 percent of import goods value, the exporter bears at least 70 percent of the incidence, and for about half of goods value, the exporter bears at least 80 percent of the incidence.8

Of course, there are goods for which importers bear material incidence, and that will mean relative price changes—but whether they prove to be relevant for aggregate prices depends on other considerations. Given the Soderbery (2018) elasticities and a split of the domestic incidence between wholesale importers and consumers, it is plausible that the ultimate effect of tariffs on consumer price levels will be in the neighborhood of two-tenths of a percent—noise.9</div>
