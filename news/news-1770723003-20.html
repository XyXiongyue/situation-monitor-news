在联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）最近的一次会议上，我得出结论，将政策利率下调25个基点是适当的政策立场，因此我持反对意见。去年三次下调政策利率使其更接近中性，但货币政策仍在限制经济活动，经济数据清楚地表明，需要进一步放松。
首先，相较于经济活动的持续稳健增长，劳动力市场依然疲软。尽管最近的读数有所下降，但失业率自去年年中以来一直在上升。2025年的工资增长非常疲软。与之前十年平均每年创造约190万个工作岗位相比，2025年的就业人数增加了近60万人。而且，去年的数据很快就会向下修正，可能会显示2025年的就业人数几乎没有增长。零。拉链。娜达。
让我们暂时了解一下——就业零增长，而平均水平几乎为

            <div class="original-content">I dissented at the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after concluding that cutting the policy rate by 25 basis points was the appropriate stance of policy. Three cuts to the policy rate last year have moved it closer to a neutral setting but monetary policy is still restricting economic activity, and economic data make it clear to me further easing is needed.

First, in contrast to the continued solid growth in economic activity, the labor market remains weak. Despite ticking down in its most recent reading, the unemployment rate has risen since the middle of last year. Payroll gains in 2025 were very weak. Compared to the prior ten-year average of about 1.9 million jobs created per year, payrolls increased just under 600,000 for 2025. And, last year's data will be revised downward soon to likely show that there was virtually no growth in payroll employment in 2025. Zero. Zip. Nada.

Let this sink in for a moment—zero job growth versus an average of almost 2 million for the 10 years prior to 2025. This does not remotely look like a healthy labor market. While lower labor supply was surely a factor, it also indicates considerable weakness in labor demand. Employers are reluctant to fire workers, but also very reluctant to hire. I have heard in multiple outreach meetings of planned layoffs in 2026. This indicates to me that there is considerable doubt about future employment growth and suggests that a substantial deterioration in the labor market is a significant risk.

Second, though inflation is elevated from tariff effects, appropriate monetary policy is to "look through" these effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are. Inflation excluding tariff effects is running close to the FOMC's 2 percent target and on a path to sustainably reach that goal.

With total inflation excluding tariff effects close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent and a weak labor market, the policy rate should be closer to neutral, which the median FOMC participant estimates is 3 percent, and not where we are—50 to 75 basis points above 3 percent. I favored reducing the policy rate to strengthen the labor market and guard against a deterioration that would be harder to address once it has begun.</div>
