在美国参议院银行、住房和城市事务委员会面前
布朗主席、斯科特委员长和委员会成员，感谢你们今天有机会出席会议。我很荣幸拜登总统被提名为美联储理事会副主席。如果得到确认，我将继续利用我的经验和专业知识，代表所有美国人追求国会赋予美联储的目标：最大限度的就业和价格稳定。
16个多月前，当我在这个委员会发表演讲时，我是一名拥有折衷研究背景的博士级经济学家：宏观经济学和货币经济学、贫困和经济不平等以及应用计量经济学。我当时假设，这些不同的专业化将为美联储面临的复杂问题提供独特的视角。作为美联储理事的一年服务已经检验了这一假设，我可以证实它的准确性。我同样从中学到了东西，也很享受

            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">📖 原文内容</h2>
            <div class="original-content">Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate

Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I am honored by President Biden's nomination to serve as Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If confirmed, I will continue to use my experience and expertise in pursuit of the goals that Congress assigned to the Federal Reserve on behalf of all Americans: maximum employment and price stability.

When I spoke to this committee over 16 months ago, I was a Ph.D. economist with an eclectic research background: macroeconomics and monetary economics, poverty and economic inequality, and applied econometrics. I posited then that these varied specializations would provide unique perspectives on the complex issues facing the Fed. One year of service as a Fed governor has tested this hypothesis, and I can confirm its accuracy. I have equally learned from and enjoyed the broad range of views around the Federal Open Market Committee table.

As a Governor, I have focused on the design, implementation, and transmission of monetary policy; served on key committees on monetary affairs, supervision and regulation, and community banks; and chair the committee on Board affairs.

The Fed's decisions affect all Americans. We consult data, empirical evidence, and research. But fully understanding the U.S. economy means understanding the experiences of those who live and work in it. Since arriving at the Federal Reserve, I have made two-way communication with the public a priority, from meeting with business and community leaders, workers, students, and retirees to public speeches.

Experience shows that achieving our dual mandate fosters an environment characterized by a dynamic labor market, thriving entrepreneurship, sustainable growth, and secure and stable savings and investment. It also provides a critical foundation for monetary policy in challenging times. Our commitment to these goals will ground inflation expectations appropriately so that policy does not encumber private economic decision-making. Long-run inclusive prosperity also requires paying careful attention to the financial system's safety and soundness.

The economy faces multiple challenges including inflation, banking-sector stress, and geopolitical instability. The Federal Reserve must remain attentive to them all. Inflation has started to abate, and I remain focused on returning it to our 2 percent target. Despite recent stress, the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient, and I remain attuned to any threats to its stability.

Before closing, I wish to acknowledge the love and support of friends and family, especially my sons Nathan and Miles. Again, thank you for the opportunity and for your consideration of my nomination.

If confirmed as Vice Chair, I look forward to working with each of you and with this Committee. I welcome your questions.</div>
